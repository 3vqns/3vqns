## About Me

I'm passionate about building intelligent systems and solving real-world challenges through technology. I enjoy writing clean, efficient code and using AI tools to bring ideas to life. Whether it's phishing detection, image classification, or conservation tech, I love turning complex problems into practical solutions.  
My experience includes:

- Creating phishing detection tools using keywords and LLMs like Gemini  
- Training AI models to detect BigGAN, Stable Diffusion, and Mini-DALLE images  
- Object detection using YOLO  
- Full-stack development in HTML/CSS and JS
